## 🚀 setup

### 1. install dependencies 📦

first, you need to install the required packages. you can do this by running the following command to install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. download and install ollama 🛠️

this project requires ollama to serve the ai model (`llama2-uncensored`). you can download ollama from the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/) and install it on your local machine.

once installed, you need to download the model:

```bash
ollama run llama2-uncensored
```

make sure ollama is running on `localhost:11434` to handle the requests.

### 3. run the script 🎬

to run the assistant, execute the following script:

```bash
python bertosito_chat.py
```

this will start a conversation with berto, who will transcribe your spoken audio and respond based on the conversation using the ai model hosted on ollama.

### 💡 how it works

- **recording audio:** berto listens to your voice and transcribes it using whisper. 🎤
- **generating responses:** it sends your transcribed text to the ai model and generates a response. 💬
- **text-to-speech:** berto will convert the generated response to speech and play it back. 🔊
- **conversation options:** the assistant presents multiple conversation options, including asking questions and following up on prior responses. 🤔

## 📂 file structure

- `bertosito_chat.py`: the main script to run berto. 🖥️
- `response.mp3` and `response.wav`: audio files generated during interaction. 🎶

### 📝 notes

- ensure that you have ollama running locally and the required models downloaded before starting the script. 🛠️
